            Bad habits<br>
            Ed Sheeran
        </div>
        <p>
            One, two, three, four<br>
            Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
        <p>
            Every time you come around, you know I can't say no<br>
            Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control<br>
            I can feel the paradise before my world implodes<br>
            And tonight had something wonderful

        <p>
        <div class="repeat">
            My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone<br>
            Conversations with a stranger I barely know<br>
            Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't<br>
            I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
        </div>
        <p>
            My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space<br>
            And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say<br>
            Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape<br>
            Nothin' happens after two, it's true<br>
            It's true, my bad habits lead to you
        <p>
        <div class="repeat">
            Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
            My bad habits lead to you<br>
            Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
            My bad habits lead to you
        </div>
        <p>
            Every pure intention ends when the good times start
        <p>
            Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark<br>
            It started under neon lights, and then it all got dark<br>
            I only know how to go too far
        <p>

        <p>
            We took the long way 'round<br>
            And burned 'til the fun ran out, now
